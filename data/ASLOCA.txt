About the rights of visit to the property by the landlord 
(found in the FAQ of ASLOCA's site):

The landlord must be able to visit the rented property. However, they are prohibited from entering it without the tenant’s prior consent.

The landlord may need to access the property for reasons such as a future sale, re-letting, or to check whether maintenance work is needed.

The tenant, for their part, must tolerate such visits as long as they are not excessive in number and provided the tenant has been notified at least five days in advance. If the tenant refuses access without justification, they may be liable for damages.

However, a landlord who enters the tenant’s home without prior consent commits a criminal offense of unlawful entry under Swiss penal law.
