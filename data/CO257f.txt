Article 257f CO from the Swiss Code of Obligations
about the tenant’s duty of care and respect:

1. The tenant is obliged to use the rented object with the necessary care.

2. If it concerns a building, the tenant must show due respect for the other residents and neighbors.

3. If the continuation of the lease becomes intolerable for the landlord or other residents because the tenant — despite a written warning — continues to breach their duty of care or fails to show respect to neighbors, the landlord may terminate the lease with immediate effect. For residential and commercial leases, the landlord may also terminate with at least 30 days’ notice for the end of a month.

4. However, residential and commercial leases can be terminated with immediate effect if the tenant deliberately causes serious damage to the property.
